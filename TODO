- add LiLo boot support (default will always stay GRUB)
- add swap partition as extended by default instead of primary (this would allow gentoo-lvm.profile and another system to dual boot)
- make a gentoo-luks-lvm.profile
- test if adding parted /dev/$i --script -- mklabel msdos
  before a classic partitioning to make sure an eventual previous GPT setup is removed
- fix inability to pre/post-hook to a skipped function
